In Zohn Ahl you run in opposite directions (one player clockwise, the other counter-clockwise) and the winner is not who gets to the finishing line first, but the player who scores most points along the track. You score points when:

* your opponent falls in the gully or in the creek
* you complete a lap 
* you land on the same space of your opponent.
