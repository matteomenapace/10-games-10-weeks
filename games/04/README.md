Apparently `torere` means [bottomless](https://translate.google.com/#mi/en/torere) in Maori?


Best explains that 
> …the centre from which the arms radiate is termed the putahi, the radiating arms are termed kawai or tentacles, the design being compared by the Maori to an octopus, from which the pattern is said to have been derived. 




> The game is played on an eight pointed star, with spaces at each point and one in the centre. Each player starts with his pieces on four adjacent points of the star. Pieces may move from one point to an empty adjacent point, or from the centre space to any empty point. A piece may only move from a point to the centre space if one or both adjacent points are occupied by an enemy piece. The object is to immobilise your opponent’s pieces.


> The game seems very simple to play — this was a common misconception of early settlers. Many have recorded in their journals of being repeatedly beaten when gambling against Māori players. Sometimes up to ten settlers would simultaneously play a single Māori player, and still lose the game.

* Deceivingly simple but complex at the same time
* 8-pointed star (this article says it’s a 9-pointed star,  without the “moving to the centre only if adjacent to an opponent piece” rule) 
* Easy to draw on sand or soil. Pieces could be shells, pebbles etc.
* Putahi (centre point) means joining paths / streams, kawai (other star points) is branches / tentaculea
* There are 86 configurations possible, and each player has 3 winning ones (see https://www.jstor.org/stable/2690304?seq=8) The same article also argues that adding more pieces & star points to the game would make it less interesting, as there would be obvious paths to winning configurations very early in the game (https://www.jstor.org/stable/2690304?seq=11)

* "Feels like you’re shuffling stones around forever" and "Pleasing until you realise this is an eternal draw" say people on BGG
