# Issues

A list of issues/phenomena that I find interesting, in no particular order.

Next to each issue is a brief comment on why I find that interesting.

* **Filter bubbles** 

	Algorithms have been affecting how we form opinions and take decisions (to vote, for example) through a *personalised* flow of ~information~ affirmation online. We believed the Web could liberate us from the media gatekeepers, but for now we're stuck with algorithmic gatekeepers. The interesting (and annoying) bit is that we don't really know how these algorithms operate, they're not transparent, and I bet many people are not even aware of their existence.
	
* **Gentrification**

	Living in London for several years, I have experienced gentrification first-hand, witnessing how people around me are *priced-out* of their homes or offices. I also feel like I'm not just a passive observer of gentrification, but I take part in it, rather indirectly, through my consumption habits. I'm sure that many of my neighbours consider me a *hipster* that moved into this street because it's been *re-developed* and it's close to the Tube.  
	
* **Environment and energy** 

	Pollution, sustainable development (not necessarily growth), environmental justice, climate change, energy crisis, waste management, CO2 emissions, clean energy, agricultural production

	My dad sparked an interest for these issues when he got into solar power (I was a primary school child). Even before that I've been always told to respect the environment and clean up after myself, so it only made sense later on to extend those moral principles to all other aspects of my daily life. I feel a sense of frustration for being part of a system where by doing nothing you're automatically doing the wrong thing (think about how much rubbish we produce).  
  
	As George Monbiot put it, climate change is the "moral question of the 21st century".

* **Education** 
  
	Access for the less advantaged/privileged, right to learn, gender balance, test-driven culture, life and vocational skills, apprenticeships, students loans.
	
	I've been in education for most of my life, first as a student and then as an educator. Despite being very successful as a student (I guess I adapted well to the education system) I am not happy with what I was taught for the most part, and as an educator I strive to create a learning environment which is collaborative and subversive (see my [teaching manifesto](https://github.com/matteomenapace/tm)).  

	- [ ] Specifically, what aspects of education do I find more interesting / urgent?
 
* **Economy**  
  
	Recession, financial crisis, poverty / homelessness, debt, workers rights, wealth redistribution, free market, market regulation, capitalism vs socialism, *extractivism*, the gig/sharing economy (precarisation)
  
* **Democracy**

	In theory, everyone can participate in decision-making. In practice, real democracy seems to be achievable only on a small scale. When there's no agreement on some basic rules and there is no trust in the pursuit of the common good, then democracy becomes vulnerable. Furthermore, when groups of interest can buy their way into the decision-making process and/or influence public opinion through powerful media channels, we have no democracy.

* **Veganism** 

	I stopped eating meat as a supposedly short "detox" experiment, after a trip to America where I had meat at every meal. I felt better, physically and mentally, so the experiment continued. Over several years I gradually dropped also fish, but I still had eggs and dairy products. Meanwhile I became more aware of the environmental impacts of my consumption habits, and I kept silencing my conscience with an incoherent *as long as animals don't die for this food...* but the truth is, taste and convenience were driving my choices. I think I was also mildly addicted to cheese. I was in free-range denial.   
  
	Thanks to Aimee I realised I had to put my so-called principles into practice and extend them to all animal products, not just those that "kill" animals (by the way, most cheese is not even vegetarian). So my choice to go vegan was a mix of ethical and environmental reasons. Why should I support an industry that I disagree with, and that causes so much harm? And I mean the farming industry in general, not just *intensive* farming: "keeping cattle or sheep on ranches, whether in the Amazon, the US, Australia or the hills of Britain, is even more of a planet-busting indulgence than beef feed-lots and hog cities, cruel and hideous as these are" as Monbiot (again) put it.
	
	Being vegan and *doing something* about climate change are deeply connected.
  
* **Human rights**  
  
	Intolerance, racism, sexism, homophobia, same-sex marriage, bullying, discrimination, inclusion of disabled people, women's rights, mental health, immigration rights
  
  - [ ] Specifically, which of the above do I find more interesting / urgent?
  
* **Technology**   
  
	Governmental and/or corporate control over communication channels, censorship, anonymity, privacy, copyright and authorship, information credibility, digital reputation, digital divide, freedom of speech, net neutrality, artificial intelligence, machine learning, the rise of the bots, blockchain... 
  
	[Here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38773878) blockchain is explained with Jenga. I understand it as a distributed ledger, i.e. a list of transactions that is replicated across a number of computers, rather than being stored on a central server. 


## Scenarios

Making a game about an issue / mega-problem as a whole may not be an effective approach: it's very hard to model (all) the complexities of an issue into a playable simulation, so you're running the risk of making something bloated & unplayable, and still not *realistic* enough.

Instead, we could focus on a particular aspect of an issue, a particular *mechanic* or *dynamic* to explore through a specific **scenario**.

For example, scenarios taken from [Hacking games with verbs](https://github.com/matteomenapace/hacking-games-with-verbs/blob/ada2017/issues.md):

* **Gentrification** People are being evicted from their homes because they can’t afford rent increases.
* **Clean energy** An incinerator has been built in a low-income neighbourhood
* **Racism / sexism** The mainstream media is portraying a minority group as a social disease
* **Globalisation** Two minority groups in a post-colonial state are in conflict with each other
* **Militarism** A wealthy industrialised state is waging war on a weaker state that is rich in natural resources
* **Censorship** In a certain nation access to certain online resources is blocked
* **Digital divide** Young people in a developing country cannot afford to buy laptops or pay for internet access
* **Totalitarianism** The government has passed a law that makes protest illegal
* **Education: equity vs equality** The government of a certain nation has risen the tuition fees for university students


At the other end of the spectrum there are [the Megaproblems of the 21st Century](http://www.jamesmartin.com/book/megaproblems.cfm) according to James Martin:

1. GLOBAL WARMING   

	Global warming will lead to severe climate change. Unless stopped, it will upset the basic control mechanisms of planet Earth.
* EXCESSIVE POPULATION GROWTH   

	World population may grow to 8.9 billion people, with a growing demand for consumer goods and carbon-based energy, far exceeding what the planet can handle.
* WATER SHORTAGES   
	
	Rivers and aquifers are drying up. Many farmers will not have the water essential for food growing. There will be wars over water.
* DESTRUCTION OF LIFE IN THE OCEANS   

	Only 10% of edible fish remain in the oceans, and this percentage is rapidly declining.
* MASS FAMINE IN ILL-ORGANIZED COUNTRIES   

	Farm productivity is declining. Grain will rise in cost. This will harm the poorest countries.
* THE SPREAD OF DESERTS   

	Soil is being eroded. Deserts are spreading in areas that used to have good soil and grassland.
* PANDEMICS   

	AIDS is continuing to spread. Infectious pandemics could spread at unstoppable rates, as they have in the past, but now with the capability to kill enormous numbers of people.
* EXTREME POVERTY   

	2 to 3 billion people live in conditions of extreme poverty, with lack of sanitation. The difference between rich and poor is becoming ever more extreme.
* GROWTH OF SHANTYCITIES   

	Shantytowns (shantycities) with extreme violence and poverty are growing in many parts of the world. Youth there have no hope.
* UNSTOPPABLE GLOBAL MIGRATIONS   

	Large numbers of people are leaving the poorest countries and shantycities, wanting to find a life in countries with opportunity.
* NON-STATE ACTORS WITH EXTREME WEAPONS   

	Nuclear or biological weapons are becoming easier to build by terrorist organisations, political groups or individuals, who are not acting for a given state.
* VIOLENT RELIGIOUS EXTREMISM   

	Religious extremism and jihads may become widespread, leading to large numbers of suicide terrorists, and religious war between Muslims and Christians.
* RUNAWAY COMPUTER INTELLIGENCE   

	Computers will acquire the capability to increase their own intelligence until a chain reaction happens of machines becoming more intelligent at electronic speed.
* WAR THAT COULD END CIVILIZATION   

	A global war like World War I or II, conducted with today's vast number of nuclear weapons and new biological weapons, could end civilization.
* RISKS TO HOMO SAPIEN'S EXISTENCE   

	We are heading in the direction of scientific experiments (described by Lord Martin Rees) that have a low probability of wiping out Homo sapiens. The combination of risks gives a relatively high probability of not surviving the century.
* A NEW DARK AGE   

	A global cocktail of intolerable poverty and outrageous wealth, starvation, mass terrorism with nuclear/biological weapons, world war, deliberate pandemics and religious insanity, might plunge humanity into a worldwide pattern of unending hatred and violence - a new Dark Age.
